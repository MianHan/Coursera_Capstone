    "In case my career as Data scientist fails (*let's hope it doesn't*), I want to open a wine bar in Paris, France. <br/> \n",

    "The problem is that, from my experience, Paris has multiple areas where people go out for a drink and these areas are not concentrated but rather spread around the city. <br/>\n",

    "Therefore, where is the best location to open a new wine bar to ensure enough clients to be successful ? <br/>\n",
    "\n",
    "As requirements to adress this problem, I will look at clients preferences when it comes to going and show relationships between the venues. Using the Foursquare data, I will geolocate the venues and find the best spot to open my wine bar."
